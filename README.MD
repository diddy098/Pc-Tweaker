If you run it through virustotal it comes out as a Trojan that shit is not true.
Its because its going into your reg files and it also goes through your system files and over all goes through important files that windows needs to run.
for the "fpsboost" file virustotal says its a "BehavesLike.Trojan.zq" and "BAT/CleanLog.A Potentially Unsafe" like I said it also goes through your system files and over all goes through important files.
Read the code if you dont belive me.

1) Make a system restore point. There is a file called "Restore Point"

2) Open "TempFileDeleter" this just deletes all the corrupted files on your computer.

3) Open "fpsboost" this changes REG files.

4) Open "Optimize" also changes REG files.
